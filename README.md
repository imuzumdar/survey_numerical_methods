# survey_numerical_methods
Survey of four relevant problems within numerical analysis: non-linear least square optimization; recurrence relations for orthogonal polynomials; divide-and-conquer algorithms for tri-diagonal eigenvalue problems; and stability and convergence analysis for generalized Euler's method in solving nonhomogenous ODEs. Paper features novel results on monic orthogonal polynomials, improving run-time to derive set of orthogonal polynomials by 33 percent.
